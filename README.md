# Bilkent-CS315-Project
- Project for the CS315- Programming Languages course in which we defined our own language called fanC++. The project consists of two parts, in the first part we made a lexical analyzer and in the second part we wrote our parser. 

## Contents
- `cs315f22_team23.lex` :  Lexical analyzer of the language.
- `cs315f22_team23.yacc` :   Parser of the language.
- `cs315f22_team23.txt` :  Example programs to test the language.
- `cs315_project_final_report` :   Final project report which includes the BNF description, explanation of the language constructions, non-trivial tokens and the evaluation of the Language.
